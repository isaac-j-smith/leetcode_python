# Python Solutions 
## About
This repo contains my python solutions to various problems found on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems) with difficulty ranging from Easy to Medium to Hard. 
## Hard Problems
### Median of Two Sorted Arrays
File: `Hard_Median_of_Two_Sorted_Arrays.py` <br/><br/>
Solution Details: 2084 / 2084 test cases passed. Runtime: 96 ms. Runtime beats 89.78 % of python3 submissions. <br/><br/>
Problem Description: <br/>
> There are two sorted arrays **nums1** and **nums2** of size **m** and **n** respectively. <br/>
> Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be **O(log (m+n))**. <br/>
> You may assume **nums1** and **nums2** cannot be both empty. <br/><br/>
> **Example 1:** <br/>
> nums1 = [1, 3] <br/>
> nums2 = [2] <br/><br/>
> The median is 2.0 <br/><br/>
> **Example 2:** <br/>
> nums1 = [1, 2] <br/>
> nums2 = [3, 4] <br/>
> 
> The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5 <br/><br/>
## Medium Problems
### Search a 2D Matrix
File: `Medium_Search_a_2D_Matrix.py` <br/><br/>
Solution Details: 136 / 136 test cases passed. Runtime: 36 ms. Runtime beats 100 % of python3 submissions. <br/><br/>
Problem Description:
> Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an **m x n matrix**. This matrix has the following properties: <br/>
> - Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
> - The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row. <br/><br/>
>
> **Example 1:** <br/>
> **Input**: matrix = [[1,   3,  5,  7],[10, 11, 16, 20],[23, 30, 34, 50]] <br/>
> target = 3 <br/>
> **Output**: true <br/><br/>
> **Example 2:** <br/>
> **Input**: matrix = [[1,   3,  5,  7],[10, 11, 16, 20],[23, 30, 34, 50]] <br/>
> target = 13 <br/>
> **Output**: false <br/><br/>
