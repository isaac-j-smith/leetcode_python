## Hard Problems
### Median of Two Sorted Arrays
File: `Hard_Median_of_Two_Sorted_Arrays.py` <br/><br/>
Solution Details: 2084 / 2084 test cases passed. Runtime: 96 ms. Runtime beats 89.78 % of python3 submissions. <br/><br/>
Problem Description: <br/>
> There are two sorted arrays **nums1** and **nums2** of size **m** and **n** respectively. <br/>
> Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be **O(log (m+n))**. <br/>
> You may assume **nums1** and **nums2** cannot be both empty. <br/><br/>
> **Example 1:** <br/>
> nums1 = [1, 3] <br/>
> nums2 = [2] <br/><br/>
> The median is 2.0 <br/><br/>
> **Example 2:** <br/>
> nums1 = [1, 2] <br/>
> nums2 = [3, 4] <br/>
> 
> The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5 <br/><br/>
